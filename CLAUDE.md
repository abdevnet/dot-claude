- Use comments sparingly.  Only comment on complex code
- Keep responses concise and focused.
- Avoid generating extra documents, summaries, or plans unless I specifically ask for them.
- Always use the batch-code-analysis-skill to break the work up into tasks running in parallel when asked to do a code review.  Each task should use the code-review-skill.
- Don't assume the date use bash date command to get current year.
