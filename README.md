A collection of skills and agents for claude.  Currently the main skills I am using are the code-review-skill along with the batch-code-analysis-skill.
To use clone this repo into your local .claude folder.  Or download the skills and agents folder and copy those folders to your .claude folder.

To try it out after updating your local .claude folder start claude code in the terminal inside of your code repo.  Ask claude to do a code review.
