description: "Prepare for context reset by priming Claude to load the transcript and the @Claude.md file."
---

I’m about to reset the context. After the reset, I will provide the file @Claude.md and then a transcript.

@Claude.md contains the authoritative project memory. After the reset, you must reread @Claude.md completely and rebuild all constraints, rules, architecture, and project understanding directly from that file.

When I say “RECONSTRUCT STATE”, rebuild your internal state from:
1. @Claude.md (authoritative project memory)
2. The transcript (our actual prior conversation turns)

Do NOT summarize.  
Do NOT reinterpret.  
Do NOT modify the rules inside @Claude.md.

Please confirm when ready for the transcript.
